Task 1: Number Guessing Game
Details:
This is a simple number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, typically 1 to 100. The user is prompted to enter their guess, and feedback is provided based on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or reaches the maximum number of attempts.

Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
Details:
This task involves a student grade calculator that computes the total marks and average percentage based on the marks obtained in multiple subjects. It then assigns a grade based on the average percentage achieved by the student.

Task 3: ATM Machine Simulation
Details:
This task involves simulating an ATM machine. It includes a user interface with options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. It manages a user's bank account by connecting the ATM class with the user's bank account class.

Task 5: Student course registration system
Details:
The Task implements a basic Student Course Registration System in Java. It manages student and course information, allowing users to add courses, display available courses, register students for courses, remove students from courses, and add new students. Each student can be associated with multiple registered courses, and each course tracks its registered students. The system uses console input for user interactions, and it is organized into methods for clarity and modularity, creating a simple yet functional student-course management system.
